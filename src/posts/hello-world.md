Hey üñêÔ∏è, Since this the first blog i've decided to make it as introduction for the blog and what it aims for . 

## But, first of all who i'm üë®‚Äçüíª ? 

**Mohamed Amine** from Algeria 32 years old , Fullstack developer using **JAVASCRIPT** stack with +7 years in the web development industry , i've build/worked on many projects such as :

- **Crispty Talk** (2020):  Content based social platform similar to **medium** , worked on it from the ground up moving at different architect levels such as Database conception, Auth Logic using passport ..and many features such as creating posts, following people .. etc.

- **Tajin** (2021): Social media platform UI & UX for Food Makers (CHEFS) .

-  **CovidStats** (2021): React.js app for local covid stats , where it shows each Province virus stats (healed, deaths, affected .. etc)

-  **AMDE** (2021): Arabic Markdown Editor , primarly created for **Crispty Talk** , so people can create posts , then abstract it as separate project , so i can use it later for others.

- **Scrap Projects** : scripts for scrapping local websites either by fetching their api directly using script or N8N (automation tool) or using Puppeteer .

- **Node Boilerplate** (2025): Currently working on plugin based node.js boilerplate so people can use it for their MVP/Saas projects , since it's plugins based , it will make them create almost any type of website without typing any line of code .. simply by adding/removing those un/wanted plugins (auth, seo, blog, theme) .. think of it as wordpress but in node.js .

- ... And More Projects but i'm not going to mention here since the post isn't about me directly .


## Back to the track 

This blog is aiming to provide insights and tools that shorten the road of entoproneurs helping them reachs their goal faster by focusing on the main factors rather than re-inventing the wheel for each time .

-  A curated list of tools that boost productions for both development and marketing fields.
- Guides that walk you step by step showing how to go from idea validation to a working MVP within short period of time .
- Insights for the new era of AI & related topics and how you position yourself since things are changing almost every few weeks .
