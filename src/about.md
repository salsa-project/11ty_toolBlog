Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm someone who's always exploring new ideas, whether it's through code, automation, or building unique solutions for everyday challenges. My journey so far has been a blend of creative problem-solving and a passion for technology.  

<br>

### What I Do  
I specialize in scripting and fullstack web development, crafting intuitive and engaging user experiences. Over time, I’ve ventured into areas like **automation workflows** using tools like n8n and **website automation** with Puppeteer. Whether it's optimizing processes for small businesses or tackling niche projects, I enjoy finding smart ways to make things easier.

<br>

### My Philosophy  
For me, simplicity and creativity go hand in hand. I believe in writing clear, descriptive code, exploring innovative solutions, and making sure every project serves a purpose. I also embrace challenges as opportunities to grow and improve, whether it’s designing e-commerce websites or automating social media workflows.

<br>

### What's Next?  
Right now, I’m working on **Qofai**, a space to bring my ideas and projects to life. It’s still in the works, but I’m excited to share what’s coming soon.

If I’m not deep into code, you’ll find me brainstorming new ways to help small businesses thrive, naming pigeons, or diving into the latest trends in Tech, AI and Automation. I’m always looking for ways to connect and collaborate, so feel free to reach out.
